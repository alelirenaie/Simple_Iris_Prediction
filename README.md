# Iris Predictor App

LINK: https://github.com/alelirenaie/Simple_Iris_Prediction

## Overview

Welcome to the Iris Predictor App repository! This application leverages machine learning to predict the species of Iris flowers based on user input. The prediction is made using a model trained on the famous Iris dataset.

## Problem Statement

The classification of Iris flowers into different species can be challenging for non-experts. This app aims to simplify the process by providing a user-friendly interface for predicting the species based on user-provided features.

## Features

- **User Input**: Users can input the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of an Iris flower.
  
- **Prediction**: The app uses a machine learning model trained on the Iris dataset to predict the species of the flower.

- **Educational Insights**: Users can explore and learn more about the Iris dataset, its features, and the significance of different species.

## Dataset

The app utilizes the well-known [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) for training the prediction model. This dataset contains measurements of 150 Iris flowers from three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/alelirenaie/Simple_Iris_Prediction/tree/main`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `python app.py`

## Usage

1. Access the app through your browser.
2. Input the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
3. Click the "Predict" button to get the predicted species.
